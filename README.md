*THIS IS A FINAL PAPER (the main objective is to learn how to develop a full web app and its infrastructure)

This project proposes a solution to the challenging issue faced by pet owners who wish to travel without their own vehicle, due to frequent restrictions on ground transport companies. The research aims to develop an innovative web platform that connects drivers, transport companies and customers, simplifying and making travel with pets less bureaucratic. Based on technologies such as Angular for the frontend and Python/Flask for the backend.

This study not only solves the identified problem, but also highlights the feasibility and efficiency of a specific technological approach to traveling with pets, suggesting a significant change in the traditional limitations imposed by public transport on pet owners.
